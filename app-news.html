Today I have released the update of the Portal 2 Mod, on which I have worked almost two months.<br>
It has been completely rewritten and basically it's like a new mod. There are many improvements and some new things too (Defective Turrets, Cube, Companion Cube). Of course it also brings compatibility with the latest version of MCPE.<br>
Download it now from <a href="http://desno365.net/minecraft/portal2-mod/">here</a>! I hope you enjoy it!<endcontent>
